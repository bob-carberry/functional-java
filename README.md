## Welcome to the functional-java project.

The purpose of this project is to show some basic functional programming paradigms with Java.

## Building

Requirements:
 - JDK 1.8.0_*. Download [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
 - Apache Maven 3. Download [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

Using your maven install execute the following terminal command from the root

`mvn clean compile test`

You can `package` or `install` with maven if you want but this project is more for illustrative purposes than an actaul library.
